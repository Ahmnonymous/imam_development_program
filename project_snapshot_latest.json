The beneficiaries of the fund are the Imam/Muallimah, their family and their community. The Hardship Relief Fund will cover the following for the Imam/Muallimah/Their family/community: 1. Medical Bills (Example doctors visits) 2. Medication 3. Relief Assistance (Sudden injury, natural disaster, unforeseen accidents) 4. Car and Home Repairs (Broken roof, new tyres, burst geyser) 5. Natural Disasters  6. Imams discretion - Any request submitted that an Imam may feel will ease the burden of another Muslim. He may submit a request to the Hardship Relief Fund.   📌 Process:  1. The Imam/Muallimah will fill in the Hardship Relief Application Form to apply for the funds.  2. Once received, we will review the application.   3. The IDP will touch base with the Imam/Muallimah if any further information is required.   4. Once approved, the money will paid out to the Imam to fulfil the request.   📌 Please note:  1. All funds are to be used to fulfil the request ONLY and not for any other reason. (Example: Imams petrol costs etc)  2. The recipients of the Hardship Relief fund can ONLY be Muslims.   3. Requests are subject to an assessment pending approval.   The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever removes a worldly hardship from a believer, Allah will remove one of the hardships of the Day of Resurrection from him. Whoever grants respite to (a debtor) who is in difficulty, Allah will grant him relief in this world and in the Hereafter. Whoever conceals (the fault of) a Muslim in this world, Allah will conceal him (his faults) in this world and in the Hereafter.

Planting trees is regarded as Sadaqatul-Jaariya (ongoing charity). The one who plants trees will be rewarded for it as long as any living being benefits from it. The Prophet Muhammed ﷺ said: “There is none amongst the Muslims who plants a tree or sows seeds, and then a bird, or a person or an animal eats from it, but is regarded as a charitable gift for him.” (Bukhari) 📌 Process: 1. The Imam/Muallimah will fill in and submit the Tree Planting Form to request the amount of tree's they are able to plant.  2. Once approved, the requestor will receive R50 per tree (Other regions) and R25 (Tanzania). If you are able to purchase more than one tree with the monies allocated per tree, you may go ahead and do so.  3. The Imam/Muallimah will source the trees locally.  4. The Imam/Muallimah and their students/community will plant the trees together.  5. Each students will be allocated a tree and is entrusted to look after their tree ensuring their tree grows best. 6. Once all trees have been planted. Send your update to the IDP Trees group.  📌 Please Note:  1. All funds are to be used for trees ONLY.   2. Trees should be at a early mature stage (50cm height (centimetres) or more  3. Any tree can be planted but fruit trees are preferable.  4.  If you are able to purchase more than one tree for R50, you may go ahead and do so.
